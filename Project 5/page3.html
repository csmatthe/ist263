       <h1>How to watch the NFL</h1>
       <p>With all your new NFL knowledge you should have a basic grasp on the NFL. Now what do you look for on TV? Don’t worry this is the easy part now. The score of each team will be displayed on the bottom of the screen and how the logo and color for each score so it isn’t confusing. Along this graphic you will also see two different clocks. One of these clocks with say either 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th next to a timer that is 15 minutes or less. This is the game clock and shows how far into the game they are. For example, if it says” 2nd 7:34” you know it’s the second quarter and there is 7 minutes 34 seconds left. The other clock will always be running down from 25 seconds, this is the play clock. To keep the game going as a decent pace of play the offense needs to start the next play before the 25 second play clock runs out, or they will get hit with a “delay of game” penalty and loose 5 yards. Now let’s talk about the downs. On the TV screen there will info. displaying what down and distance the offense is on. As a refresher this could be 2nd and 4. Depending on the broadcast the location of this info will change on the screen, but no matter what it will always be there, so you don’t need to keep track of anything, just look for the graphic. When the play is being ran it can be hard to tell where the first down marker is, even if you know the distance to it from the down and distance graphic. The broadcast makes this extremely easy for you by showing the yellow horizontal line, this line signifies the distance the offense needs to reach to convert the downs. This will be everything you need to easily enjoy the game of football on TV. </p>

       <h1>Now if you want to talk about football with people that may know more than you here are some good conversations starters.</h1>

       <h1>Jets and Aaron Rodgers</h1>
       <img src="../projectimages/arod.jpeg" alt="a photo of aaron rodgers">
       <p>The New York Jets and Aaron Rodgers were the biggest story coming into this season. This is because of the Jets are, for the past few years a bad, or loosing NFL team, and Aaron Rodgers, the 4-time NFL MVP and Superbowl Champion was just traded to the Jets. This created a massive shift in the team’s chances to win and team mentality. Everybody was excited to see how this team would do. BUT unfortunately, on Aaron Rodgers only got to play for a little more than a minute and for only 4 plays. This is because he suffered and injury, to be specific it was a tear of the Achilles tendon, which is a season ending injury, and possibly career ending. This was major letdown but anybody who watches football would love to give their thoughts and opinions on this.</p>

       <h1>Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers</h1>
       <img src="../projectimages/baker.jpeg" alt="a photo of baker mayfield">
       <p>Following Tom Brady’s retirement from the Buccs (Buccaneers) (Tom Brady is the most successful NFL player ever) The Tampa Bay buccaneers are missing the most important position in the NFL the QB. This means they had to trade or draft for somebody; they ended up trading for QB Baker Mayfield. Baker is a polarizing NFL player from his attitude to his fluctuating play on the field. This year, as of writing this (Week 2 of 2023 season) Baker has proved himself to be a starting QB, he has won both of his first two games and played very well. This is a good conversation because depending on who you ask, they will give very different perspectives and opinions on Baker and his situation.</p>

       <h1>Colorado Buffalos, and Deion Sanders</h1>
       <img src="../projectimages/colorado.jpeg" alt="a photo of colorado's football team">
       <img src="../projectimages/sanders.jpeg" alt="a photo of dieon sanders">
       <p>The Colorado Buffalos is a college football team, but the story they are creating is relevant and interesting to any football fan. Colorado has not been a historically good football team, but they started to revolutionize the team. This is because of the hiring of a new coach, Deion Sanders, (or for fun as the teams calls him, Coach Prime, this comes from his NFL nickname ‘Primetime”) Deion is a Hall of Fame NFL Cornerback, and arguably the best of all time. Outside of his play, his personality is and was unmatched, he is a spectacle for anybody to hear and watch. When Colorado hired him, he continued to do something no coach has ever done, int eh NFL or college, he kicked of 99% of to current team, and continued to hand select an entire new team, with a focus on athleticism and attitude similar towards his. Two of these players included two of his sons, Shilo and Shedeur Sanders. One being a Safety and one being the QB. This team not only did something no other team has ever done before, but as of writing this (Week 3 of the 2023 college season) they are undefeated and proving to everybody that they are a real team and not something to mess with. This is something that Colorado Football has never seen before, and even more than that something nobody has ever seen, it is truly revolutionary. </p>

       <h1>Superbowl</h1>
       <img src="../projectimages/superbowl.jpeg" alt="a photo of a player holding up superbowl trophy">
       <p>Asking who you think will win the Superbowl or has a chance you can ask anybody. Everybody has different opinions on who’s the best and has a chance to go all the way. It’s too early in the season to have a truly ‘safe’ pick, but that also creates more polarizing and controversial opinions, so have fun with it.</p>

       <h1>What team should you follow?</h1>
       <img src="../projectimages/teams.jpeg" alt="image of NFL teams">
       <p>In the NFL most people root for the team in which they grew up. For example, in somebody grew up in San Francisco, usually they would be a San Francisco 49’s fan. If you’re from New York, you will have two choices because there are 2 New York teams in the NFL. If you are not a fan of the team you are from, or you didn’t grow up with a clear NFL team to follow, have fun. Choose whoever you want to root for, and you can be as casual or serious as you want. Sticking with that team for the rest of your life or chance your team every week. It is also popular to follow whatever team has the most news surrounding it, being this type of fan is known as a ‘bandwagon’. Generally, that’s not a good term, but you can support whoever you want in the end, and you can take this as a compliment if your truly wanted.  </p>
