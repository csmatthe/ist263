<h2>Scoring</h2>
<img src="../projectimages/scoreboard2.jpeg">
<p>In the NFL there are 4 ways to score points, these are a touchdown, safety (different from the defensive position), extra point, and 2-point conversion. A touchdown is the most common and desired way to score. A touchdown is worth 6 points. A touchdown can occur if the offense is able to get the football in the endzone, overall, it doesn’t matter who scores or how, it is always 6 points. The defense is also able to score a touchdown if they can take away the football from the offense and run it the other way into the other endzone without being tackled or pushed out of bounds. After scoring a touchdown the scoring team is presented with 2 options, a 2-point conversion and a extra point. An extra point is when the team will send out a kicker and he will attempt to kick the football 33 yards through the goal posts, if the football goes through the team is rewarded with 1 point. On the other hand, there is a 2-point conversion, when this option is chosen the offense will line up again on the 2-yard line and attempt to get the football in the endzone again, if it is successful the team is rewarded with 2 points. If any of these two options fail the ball is still given back to the other team and the scoring team only gets the touchdown points. Most of the time after a touchdown the team will chose to kick a extra point because the odds of it scoring are higher than a 2-point, the 2-point conversion is there to help a team comeback from a deficit faster, it’s a high risk high reward play. A field goal occurs when a team is close to scoring a touchdown but ran out of plays to run, the kicker, from anywhere on the field (usually under 60 yards total or less) will kick the football and try to get it through the goal posts, if successful the team is rewarded with 3 points and the ball is given the other team. If it is missed the team is rewarded with nothing and still turns over the ball. A safety is rare but still relevant, this occurs when the offense is backed up all the way to their own endzone and then proceeds to run a play that results in a tackle inside wither own endzone.  This will reward the defensive team with 2 points and also give the ball back to them, because of the circumstance for it to happen it isn’t very common. </p>

<h2>Downs</h2>
<img src="../projectimages/down.jpeg" alt="ref holding up 3 fingers to signal its third down">
<p>Knowing the down system in the NFL is crucial to understanding what is happening. The downs aren’t too complicated to understand. When the offense has the football, they are given 4 downs to convert. This means that the offense has 4 plays to move the ball 10-yards to reset the downs. Being able to cross this ten-yard mark is known as a first-down. Although I just stated how the offense has 4 down to convert it is usually only 3, this is because if the offense is not able to convert the defense gets the ball where they ended, so to combat this the 4-down is most often reserved for a field goal if the offense is close enough to score, or a punt, in which the punter will punt the ball as far as he can. This is because they are giving the ball to the other team, and it is helpful to have the other team be as far back on the field as possible, so they need to move the ball farther which is more difficult. If a first down is achieved the next set of down will start where the previous play ended. Understanding the lingo of this is simple too, for example if a team is on their second down and needs 6 yards to convert, you would say they are 2nd and 6, another example would be if they are on 3-down and need 1 yard, they would be 3rd and 1. You have probably heard many versions of this when hearing people watch football. With this being said it might be obvious that it’s the goal of the defense is to try and not let the offense covert a 1st down. </p>

<h2>Different Plays</h2>

<p>The versatility of plays that the offense can run is virtually endless so explaining everything would be too much even for many avid fans, but there are some essential things you need to know. First off the offense can do one of two things on any given play, run the ball, or pass the ball. Both can occur in basically any way and guessing what is going to happen before the snap is difficult, as they are even trying to hide it from the pro NFL players. Once the ball is snapped to the QB (a ‘snap’ is when a O- line member throws the ball to the quarterback, this starts the play) if the quarterback hold onto the ball you can safely say it’s a pass play, although it can be a run its unlikely and often improvised, not planned. If the QB gives the ball to the running back it is a run play. The defense can do 1 of 3 main things to combat this. One of these options is zone coverage, this occurs when the defense is confident in the pass play. When this occurs all defenders outside of the D-Line drop back and cover individual zones on the field, this is great against the pass, but an experienced QB will be able to pick apart the holes in between zones and pass the ball. The second option of the defense is the blitz, you may have heard of this term as it is very commonly used. As the name states this is when the defense commits to the run play and most of the defenders will run at the QB and or RB in hopes of quickly tackling them to make them loose yards and minimize the run. This is risky as if the offense senses the blitz coming, they can throw a quick pass to combat it and usually beat the defense as most of the defenders are occupied blitzing.  The third option is also good against the pass and run, but you can think of it as a hybrid of zone and blitz. This is called man-coverage. This is when each defender is assigned to a specific player and will attempt to mirror the WR, RB, and TE one-on-one. This is usually dependent on who is playing, and how good/fast you DB’s are on defense. For example, if the offense has a star WR it is unlikely that the defense will run man-coverage because the star WR will most likely beat the one-on-one match up. On the other side if the defense has good DB’s they will be able to cover the WR successfully. If this is done by the defense it will result in a drop pass, sack of the QB, or interception, so in other words high risk, very high reward. </p>

<h2>Penalties</h2>
<img src="../projectimages/flag.jpeg" alt="image of penalty flag">
<p>The NFL has the biggest rule book in any sport, so explaining all the rules and penalties would take way too long and be overwhelming, even for most avid fans. There are some basic penalties and rules you should know though. First off let’s start with the start of the play. As stated, before the Center O- lineman will snap the ball to start the play on the field. Knowing that if the defense, or offense creates too much movement prior to the snap they will be hit with a penalty. If the offense were to start moving before the ball is snapped, they will be hit with a ‘False start’ penalty, this will set the offense back 5 yards and they will restart the play on the same down. If the defense were to move before the snap (Linebackers and DB’s are allowed movement but that, is it) they can get hit with ‘offsides’ penalty, there are nuances to this, but it is irrelevant to understanding the game. This will cause the offense to gain 5 yards and restart the play. After the play is started there are many penalties that can occur, but none more common than “offensive holding”. This means one of the offensive players, usually the O-Line is caught holding the back, instead of blocking them. This may be hard to visualize so refer to the image. This will result in the offense moving back ten yards from where to play started, no matter how successful the play is. For the next penalty it can apply to both offense and defense. These are OPI (Offensive pass interference) and DPI (Defensive pass interference) This occurs only on pass plays, and it happens when either the defender or offender creates too much contact prior to the ball getting to the player. If the offender pushes the defender then catches the ball, they will be hit with a OPI, on the other hand if the defender interferes with the offender prior to the pass they will be hit with a DPI. These are by far the most common penalties and most others can be explained by the name and don’t need further explanation, such as a ‘Unnecessary Roughness Penalty”. It’s also good to note that when a penalty is called the Ref will throw a yellow flag on the field to signify there was a penalty. </p>
