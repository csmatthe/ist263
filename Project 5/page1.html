    <h2>What is the NFL</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/logo.jpeg" alt="NFL logo">
    <p>The NFL, or National Football League is the pinnacle of football for these athletes. It is the professional league for football and every Sunday, Monday, and Thursday during the NFL season (Sept-Feb) there is a game or games being played for you to watch and enjoy. </p>

    <h2>Basic overview of footbaoll</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/football.jpeg" alt="image of football">
    <p> Football is a high contact sport in which each team takes turns trying to score the most points possible, and by the end whoever has the most points, regardless of how it happens wins the game. The game is made up of 4, 15-minute quarters, totaling to 60 minutes of play time, but the clock stops often in football so the games are longer than 1 hour. There are 18 weeks of regular season play, with one game a week. There are only 17 games played though as every team has one break week. After the regular season is the playoffs, then SuperBowl.  There are 32 total teams within the NFL. </p>

    <h2>NFL Field</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/field.svg" alt="standard football field">
    <p>To start let’s talk about the field a NFL field is 120 yards long and 53.3 yards long. 100 of the 120 yards used in the length are the actual playing field, the other 20 yards are split into two 10 yard sections on each end of the field. These 10-yard sections are called the ‘endzone’. In the back of each endzone there is a “goalpost”, these are a yellow, Y-shaped structure, the gap in between the ‘y’ shape is 18.5 feet and the height of it ends at 35 feet, but you need to think of it as going all the way up to the sky. On the main playing field there are many horizontal lines, each of these full horizontal lines mark each 5 yards and, on the side, you can see the distance, for example, if it says ‘20’ you are on the 20-yard line. Once you get to 50 yards it starts to go back down to zero, it goes up to 50 and back down, not 0-100. It is a symmetrical field. In the middle of the field, the 50-yard line, you can see the home team’s logo, this will tell you which teams field they are playing at. With some rare special exceptions each team has their own home field in their state. This is everything you need to know about the NFL field. </p>

    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/teams.jpeg" alt="nfl teams">
    <p>Each of the two NFL teams playing is made up of a 53-man roster. These 53 men on a team will include their defense, offense, special teams, and backups. The offense has 11 players on the field at any given time, and so does the offense. This means that during every play there are 22 players in the field. </p>

    <h2>Offense</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/offense.svg" alt="standard football offense lineup">
    <p>The offense includes 11 players, made up of offensive linemen (O-Line), a quarterback (QB), running back (RB), tight end (TE), fullback (FB), and receivers (WR). Aside from the quarterback the number of receivers, O-linemen, tight ends etc. will vary depending on the team and play being run. This will sound more complicated that it is don’t worry! The quarterback is the most vital positions, every single play the QB will touch the ball and either throw the ball, give the ball to his running back, or run the ball himself. The O-Line is the line of  5 ‘big-men’ , again this number can slightly vary, but the O-line  block the quarterback from being hit, or block the defense so the running back has space to run. WR’s stand on the outside of the O-Line and run out when the play starts to try and catch the ball if it is thrown. The RB stands next to, or behind the QB and is there to help block the defense on a pass play, or is given the ball to run, which is his main role. The tight-end is a more complicated position, it is the most versatile position, the tight-end essentially combined the O-Line and WR, he can block the defense and or run out for a pass. Finally the FB, this is a position in the NFL that is rare and for lack of a better word “old”. Few teams utilize a full back, but the role would be to block people for the running back, he would run in front of the RB to help make space for him. </p>

    <h2>Defense</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/defense.svg" alt="standard football defense lineup">
    <p>Again, the Defense is made up of 11 players. Before we start the defense is more versatile in who is being used, what this means is that the number of players in any given position can, and usually will change depending on the play, but most often it mirrors the offense. The positions on the defense include the D-Line,  or defensive line, the Linebackers (LB), the cornerback , also called defensive backs (DB), and safety (S) With that being said we will start with the D-line, the D-line is essentially the opposite of the O-Line, the lineup against the O-Line and try to get through them to tackle the QB or RB. The DB’s will line up against the WR’s and try to mirror them to block the pass if it is thrown to their assigned receiver or tackle anybody who gets the ball. The LB are the ‘leaders’ of the defense, they control the field and stand in the middle of all the defenders, they can stand back to help pass-block, or they can rush the D-Line to try a tackle the RB or QB. The LB are extremely versatile and can essentially do anything. The safety is like a DB but he isn’t assigned to a specific receiver, they stand far back and are there in case there is a long offensive play, as the name states they are a ‘last resort’ for a defense and made to be a safety precaution to stop the long play touchdowns, there are nuances to this position and it can do more but that is the main role and all you need to know at this time. An important note that the defense can stop the play in 6 different ways. One of these being tackling the offensive member with the ball, another being pushing the offensive player out of bounds. Outside of the obvious the defense can get an interception, which is when a defender catches the football, resulting in a turnover. (a ‘turnover’ is when the offense gives the ball back to the other team). The defense can force a turnover by making the offense fumble the ball too, if this occurs the defense will need to grab the ball before the offense to make the turnover occur, otherwise the offense will get the ball back. The defense can sack the QB, this means the QB is tackled for a loss of yards while looking to pass the ball. The last way they can end the play is a PBU. (Pass break up) as the name states this is when a pass is thrown and the defender blocks or breaks up the pass resulting it in ball hitting the ground and ending the play. </p>

    <h2>Special Teams</h2>
    <img src="../projectimages/kicking.jpeg" alt="image of somebody kicking a football">
    <p> Special teams is what it sounds like, they are essential but used int specific circumstances. The nuances of the special teams are not important to understand, what is important is the kicker and punter. The kicker kicks the football for a kickoff or field goal (this will be explained later) and the punter punts the football to give it back to the other team. </p>
